# 🌩️ AWS DevOps Projects

Welcome!  
This repository is my **AWS DevOps Portfolio**, where I collect all my hands-on projects demonstrating architecture, automation, and DevOps best practices on AWS.  
Each project is built with real-world scenarios and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles.

---

## 🧭 Overview

This repo serves as a **central hub** linking to my individual AWS and DevOps projects.  
Each project repository includes documentation, Terraform code, architecture diagrams, and deployment steps.
